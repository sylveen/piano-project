        The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year
        1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a
        softer material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). It is played
        using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the
        fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings.

        The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte, the Italian term for the early 1700s versions of the
        instrument, which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte(key cymbal with quieter and louder)[1] and
        fortepiano. The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate "soft" and "loud" respectively,[2] in this
        context referring to the variations in volume (i.e., loudness) produced in response to a pianist's touch or
        pressure on the keys: the greater the velocity of a key press, the greater the force of the hammer hitting the
        strings, and the louder the sound of the note produced and the stronger the attack. The name was created as a
        contrast to harpsichord, a musical instrument that does not allow variation in volume; compared to the
        harpsichord, the first fortepianos in the 1700s had a quieter sound and smaller dynamic range.[3]

        A piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings, which are strung
        under great tension on a heavy metal frame. Pressing one or more keys on the piano's keyboard causes a wooden or
        plastic hammer (typically padded with firm felt) to strike the strings. The hammer rebounds from the strings,
        and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency.[4] These vibrations are transmitted through a
        bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air. When the key
        is released, a damper stops the strings' vibration, ending the sound. Notes can be sustained, even when the keys
        are released by the fingers and thumbs, by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument. The sustain pedal
        enables pianists to play musical passages that would otherwise be impossible, such as sounding a 10-note chord
        in the lower register and then, while this chord is being continued with the sustain pedal, shifting both hands
        to the treble range to play a melody and arpeggios over the top of this sustained chord. Unlike the pipe organ
        and harpsichord, two major keyboard instruments widely used before the piano, the piano allows gradations of
        volume and tone according to how forcefully or softly a performer presses or strikes the keys.
